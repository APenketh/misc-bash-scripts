# misc-scripts
A Repository For Holding Small Scripts That Don't Deserve Their Own Repo.

- dump-all-mysql-databases.sh - A "very!" basic bash scripts to dump all of the databases that the defined user has access to. Can be easily run from a cron job for daily backups etc.

- hotadd-ubuntu-vmware.sh - A script to hot-add CPU and memory to a Ubuntu guest in VMware. Not my orignal making but very useful
